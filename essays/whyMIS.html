  <h2 id="what-got-me-interested-in-mis">What got me interested in MIS?</h2>

<p>I decided to major in MIS because I have always found technology fascinating. I am always keeping up with the latest tech and I want to be able to work with tech in my career path. I am also majoring in accounting, and hopefully, I will be able to combine these two majors into something very useful for me. Another reason I am majoring in MIS is because of the career path and stability it offers. I know that with this degree I will always be able to find a job as technology will grow into our everyday lives more over the future.</p>

<p>I originally did not know what MIS was until I reached my junior year in college. I originally thought that there was no major in business relating to technology and it disappointed me to think that I would not be able to work with it in the future.  Luckily after talking to my advisor she recommended taking this course and double majoring in accounting and MIS. I am grateful for this and I hope to make the best out of it and continue my academic career in two majors instead of just one.  In conclusion, these are the reasons why I chose to major in MIS and take ITM 352.</p>
