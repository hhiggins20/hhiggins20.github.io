  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The WOD that I am writing this essay about is Invoice 1 WOD.  The link to the WOD instructions is <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html"> 
this</a>.</p>

<p>This was the last WOD that I completed and it was due on February 13th.</p>

<h2 id="my-experience-with-invoice-1">My Experience With Invoice 1</h2>

<p>While performing this WOD I was able to blast through the first few steps in the instructions.  On my first try, I was able to get through steps 1-7 in around 7 minutes, which made me think that I was almost done.  What I did not expect, however, was how challenging step 8 would be.  Creating and converting a table from HTML to JavaScript was not something I had done before.  This singular step ended up causing me to DNF on the first try.  I struggled a lot trying to figure out how to fully convert the table, and it took me a while to finally understand that I had to use the document.write() command for me to get the table to load.</p>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

<p>To prepare for this WOD I originally scanned the entirety of the instructions first so that I would have a good idea of what I needed to do.  I find it works best for me if I know what steps come after the ones that I am currently working on.  It gives me an idea of the bigger picture and helps me when it comes to formatting my code.  These are the same steps that I take for each of the WODs that I work on.  It allows me to work faster and also helps with my commentary so I do not have to spend much time reading what the next step I am going to take will be.</p>

<h2 id="for-the-future">For the Future</h2>

<p>In the future, I will continue to work on the WODs in the same way that I am working on them currently.  I think that if I were to change anything it would be that I do some research on each of the steps before I fully dive into trying the WOD.  I spend a lot of time doing trial and error when I could spend that time looking up what I need to do and trying to understand why I need to do it that way.  I will also keep working on formatting my code better in each WOD.  I do not use enough notes in my code explaining what each thing does, and it often complicates things when I do not know what is not working.</p>
