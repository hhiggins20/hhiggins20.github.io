## Browser History 1

To me, Browser History 1 was the most enjoyable and challenging WOD out of the first three that we did.  This is because Browser History 1 involved creating a website from scratch that explains the history of the internet and web browsers.  I was able to finish this WOD on my first try with just enough time left to spare.  It took me about 24 minutes of editing code for my website to finally look the way that it was intended.  I ended up having to do some research during the WOD on how to code certain items into the website.  One of these was trying to link a section of the page to the table of contents.  Before this exercise, I had only linked to external sizes on my websites so it took a bit of experimenting to find out how to id items and link to them.

## Browser History 2

Browser History 2 was the easiest of the three WODs that I worked on.  This was because not much had to be changed between the original website, and the new website.  I was able to finish the WOD on my first try in about 18 minutes, and it only took this long because I had issues with google fonts not loading properly.  Once I was able to code the fonts into my style sheet the rest of the exercise was not too difficult.  Here and there I would have to go back to the CSS tutorial to remind myself how to do things such as add margins to a page.  Overall Browser History 2 was not as bad as Browser History 1, but I did run into a couple of issues.

## Browser History 3

Browser History 3 was personally the most annoying WOD that we were assigned.  This WOD took me 3 tries to finally finish and that was because my page columns kept overlapping with each other even with the padding.  This was super annoying because even when I looked at the screencast for help I still was not able to figure out my problem.  In the end, I was able to find out that the issue was that one of my columns was about 1 pixel too big and it caused the entire webpage format to break on itself.  Once I fixed it everything worked as normal, but it definitely tested my patients.

## Conclusion

When working on the Browser History WODs I would recommend having the beginner HTML and CSS tutorials open on another tab.  This is because sometimes you will forget something small and have to end up searching for it. If you already have the page open it will end up saving time and you will not have to rush as much to finish the WOD on time.  Overall these exercises were fairly challenging, but also engaging as I enjoyed putting the skills that I learned so far in this class up to the test.
