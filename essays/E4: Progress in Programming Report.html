  <h1 id="my-programming-skills-have-greatly-improved-in-the-following-ways">My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:</h1>

<p>So far since I began taking this class my programming skills have improved immensely.  When I began taking this class I knew next to nothing about programming, with my most advanced experience being the HTML I made in ISC101.  From not even knowing what JavaScript was, to be able to create my webpage and server is huge growth.  I have learned how to understand code and think through it critically during my time in this class.</p>

<h1 id="i-need-to-work-on-the-following-to-improve-my-programming-skills">I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:</h1>

<p>I need to work on learning how to solve problems in the code that I write.  As of now, I struggle with finding out what is causing the errors in my code and I often rely on outside sources to figure out what is broken.  I can also improve my commenting skills, as a lot of the time I will write multiple lines of code without commenting on what I am doing with them.</p>

<h1 id="i-have-learned-a-lot-from-doing-wods-and-i-can-do-them-without-copying-the-screencast">I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:</h1>

<p>I agree with this statement, as I only watched the screencasts of the WODs after I had finished them on my own just to see the difference between what I did and what my professor did.  I believe the WODs were what helped my progress in coding the most out of any of the things that we have done so far in class.  They are what helped me use the skills that we learned in the labs and put them to the test.</p>

<h1 id="the-labs-have-helped-me-learn-and-i-am-able-to-complete-them-with-confidence">The labs have helped me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:</h1>

<p>I agree with this statement, as the labs were what introduced me to each of the topics that we went over in class.  With the slow introduction to coding skills through the labs I was able to progressively understand how to do things later in the WODs on my own.  A good example was the functions lab.  In the beginning, I had no idea what a function was and no idea how I was going to do the WODs, but after completing the lab I was able to put together how functions work.</p>

<h1 id="i-learned-a-lot-from-my-experience-doing-assignment-1-and-feel-ready-to-work-on-assignment-2">I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:</h1>

<p>I somewhat agree with this statement because I did learn a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1, but at the same time, I am not fully ready for Assignment 2 because the progression in this class is going extremely fast.  Luckily we are towards the end but I am happy that soon I will be able to give myself a little bit of a break in summer and go back to relaxing during my afternoons.</p>

<h1 id="i-think-the-class-can-be-improved-to-help-my-learning-in-the-following-ways">I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:</h1>

<p>I think the class could be improved to help my learning more by there being more WOD screencasts that are released once the WODs are completed.  Sometimes once I completed a WOD I would not fully understand if what I did was correct, or could be improved, and having a reference would help a lot in this department as it could encourage different types of thinking.</p>

<h1 id="what-helps-me-the-most-in-class-are-wods-labs-class-website-screencasts-readings-quizzes-one-on-one-help-working-with-classmates-etc">What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):</h1>

<p>The things that help me the most in class are the Labs and WODs.  The class website personally doesnâ€™t have that much helpful information compared to actually being in the class itself.  The quizzes felt kinda like afterthoughts, but I did enjoy doing the labs and WODs.  These examples had a hand on experience which in my opinion is the best way to learn new things.</p>
